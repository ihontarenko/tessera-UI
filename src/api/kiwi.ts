 * Make a Kiwi page's links resolve **against Kiwi** (TSSR-0101).
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Why a document needs this at all</h2>
 *
 * Kiwi stores images and attachments as **root-relative** paths — `![a dot](/api/public/files/…)`. On
 * Kiwi's own screens that is right and survives any deployment. Rendered here it is a lie: the browser
 * resolves it against **Tessera's** origin, which has no such route, and every picture on every page is
 * a broken image. That is exactly what the first real page drawn in the wiki tab looked like.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ The base comes from Kiwi, not from a constant here</h2>
 *
 * Two consumers each keeping their own copy of Kiwi's address is two places to get it wrong, and the
 * second one to get it slightly wrong is the one nobody notices. So `assetBase` travels on the payload
 * with the markdown that needs it.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ ONLY `/api/public/files/…`, and the narrowness is the whole correctness</h2>
 *
 * The first version of this rewrote **every** root-relative link, and it was wrong in a way the imported
 * manual demonstrates on its second page: it contains `[Innoventa landing page](/)`. That link means
 * *Innoventa's* landing page — the document was written inside Innoventa and its own links point there.
 * A blanket rewrite would have silently redirected it to Kiwi's root.
 *
 * So the rule is not "relative links belong to Kiwi". It is: **the file route is Kiwi's, and nothing
 * else in the document can be assumed to be.** `/api/public/files/{id}` is written by Kiwi's own editor
 * when somebody inserts a picture, which is exactly why it can be recognised and exactly why nothing
 * else can.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ What it therefore leaves alone</h2>
 *
 * Every other link: absolute URLs, `mailto:`, anchors, page-relative paths, **and any other
 * root-relative path**, which belongs to whichever product the author had in mind. Also raw
 * `<img src="/…">` — a looser expression would eventually rewrite a path shown as an example inside a
 * code fence, silently editing a document that was explaining something.

 *
 * <h2>⚠️ This is not tidiness — without it the rewrite corrupts the document</h2>
 *
 * `MarkdownField` is an **editor**: whatever it was given is what comes back out of `onCommit`. Hand it
 * the resolved text and the next save writes **Tessera's view of Kiwi's address** into Kiwi's own
 * database — permanently, for every reader, including Kiwi's own screens. That is exactly the failure
 * TSSR-0101 rejected storing absolute URLs to avoid, arrived at from the other side.
 *
 * <p>So the pair is symmetric and must stay symmetric: resolve on the way in, unresolve on the way out.
 * ⚠️ A future editor that saves without passing through here reintroduces the bug silently — the page
 * looks right in both products until somebody moves Kiwi.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ It strips **only this base**. A link somebody deliberately wrote as an absolute URL to Kiwi —
 * because they meant it to survive being copied elsewhere — is indistinguishable from a rewritten one,
 * and is therefore also stripped. That is the known cost, and it is smaller than the alternative:
 * leaving a rewritten link absolute forever.

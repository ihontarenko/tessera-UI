/**
 * The one way this application opens a panel next to something.
 *
 * ⚠️ **No JavaScript computes a position here, and that is the whole point.** Text size is applied as
 * `zoom` (see `ThemeContext`), and a JS positioner cannot survive it: floating-ui divides a trigger's
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` by the scale it detects — which for a zoomed element *is* the zoom — and
 * then cannot reconcile a `position: fixed` containing block. Measured, trigger at y=18 at 1.5×: the
 * panel opened at y=654 with the zoom on `body`, and at y=436 with it on the application root. There is
 * no zoom host that fixes it, because the arithmetic itself is what is wrong.
 *
 * So the browser does it. `anchor-name`/`position-anchor`/`position-area` anchor the panel during
 * normal layout, where every length already agrees, and `position-try-fallbacks` flips it when the
 * chosen side will not fit. Measured across 1×/1.25×/1.5×, both zoom hosts, and a trigger inside the
 * fixed sidebar: the gap scales with the zoom and the edges align to the pixel.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ The top layer, via the native popover</h2>
 *
 * The panel is a `popover`, so it renders in the top layer. That buys three things a hand-rolled
 * absolutely-positioned panel does not have: it is never clipped by an ancestor's `overflow: hidden`
 * (a table cell, a card, a toolbar), it never loses a z-index argument, and light dismiss plus Escape
 * are the platform's rather than two document-level listeners per open panel.
 *
 * It also inherits `body`'s zoom like anything else in the document, so the panel renders at the
 * application's text size with nothing to reapply.
 *
 * <h2>Browser floor</h2>
 *
 * CSS anchor positioning is Chromium-only today (Chrome 125+; this application runs on 151). Tessera is
 * an internal tool on Chrome, and the alternative was a positioner that is wrong in every browser. When
 * Firefox and Safari ship it, nothing here changes.

/**
 * A Markdown field that is read in place and written in place — but not, unlike
 * {@link ../inline/InlineTextField}, by being an input the whole time.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Why this one has an edit mode when nothing else in Tessera does</h2>
 *
 * <p>The inline pattern works because a summary looks the same typed as it does read. A description
 * does not: a table, a `;;;mermaid` diagram and a `TES-42` reference are the *rendered* thing, and a
 * field that were permanently a textarea would mean nobody ever sees them. So this shows the document
 * and swaps to the editor on request.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **And it commits on a button rather than on blur**, which is the other break from the inline
 * pattern and the reason it cannot simply reuse it. The editor's toolbar opens dialogs; a dialog takes
 * focus; commit-on-blur would save a half-finished document every time somebody reached for the link
 * button. Escape still abandons, because that is the one habit worth keeping.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Who opens the editor is the caller's decision, not this component's</h2>
 *
 * <p>A comment is prose and a click into it means "let me fix that word". **A description is not**: it renders
 * live blocks — checkboxes, diagrams, applets — that somebody is meant to *use*, and a click that
 * replaces the thing under the cursor with its own source is the field eating the interaction. So a
 * surface carrying live blocks passes `openOnClick={false}` and drives {@link editing} from a button
 * and a shortcut of its own; a surface of plain remarks keeps the click.

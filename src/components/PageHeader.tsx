// title with a 12px muted subtitle 2px below it, border-bottom.
//
// The -mx-4 -mt-4 cancels ApplicationLayout's content wrapper's own p-4 (this is always that
// wrapper's first child) so the border-bottom — and the header's own background — reach the true
// left/right/top edges the way Innoventa's .topbar does (it sits outside any padded container
// entirely). px-6/pt-[18px]/pb-[13px] then re-establish Innoventa's own inset from those true edges,
// so the title/actions land in the same visual position regardless of the cancel-and-reapply.

      {/* ⚠️ **Dropping to a row of its own is not the same as fitting on it.** `flex-wrap` above puts
          the actions under the title, and they still ran off the right edge, because a wrapped flex
          item is offered the line's width and `shrink-0` refuses it: a `w-64` search field plus a
          Button (each one shrink-0 whitespace-nowrap) is ~400px of refusal on a 375px phone, and there
          is nowhere to scroll to the remainder — the only scroller in the application is vertical,
          inside an overflow-hidden SidebarInset. So: full-width and shrinkable below `sm`, and the
          unshrinkable cluster at the right it has always been from `sm` up.

          ⚠️ The `data-slot=input` rule is what makes that fit look deliberate rather than ragged. Left
          alone flex wraps before it shrinks, so the field keeps its 256px and the primary button drops
          to a third row by itself; `flex-1` re-bases the field on what is actually left over — it
          already carries `min-w-0`. Fields only: a button must never be stretched to fill. */}

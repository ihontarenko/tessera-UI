/**
 * The conversation the server hands back, read once and turned into what a screen draws.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no second copy of the conversation.</strong> The runner is stateless and returns
 * the whole message array, so this file derives everything the transcript shows from that one array —
 * the questions, the answers, which actions ran and what each of them came back with. A parallel list
 * of "things to display", grown alongside it, would be a second history that drifts from the first the
 * moment a turn is retried, and the drift would show as an answer attributed to the wrong question.
 *
 * <p><strong>It is deliberately defensive.</strong> Every block here is a provider's own shape, carried
 * untouched by the library so the round trip survives what it does not understand — which means this
 * file is reading somebody else's JSON and must never throw on a shape it did not expect. Anything
 * unrecognised is skipped, and the worst outcome is a quieter transcript rather than a blank screen.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <strong>A copy of Innoventa's, and deliberately not shared.</strong> The two products keep no
 * code in common — that decision is documented — and what they do share is the library's wire shape,
 * which is why the same reader works against both. If one of them ever needs a change here, it changes
 * here alone.

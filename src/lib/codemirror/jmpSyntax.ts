/**
 * `.jmp` — jMouse Policy, the language authorization is written in.
 *
 * <p>Built exactly like {@link ./jmeSyntax}: a `StreamLanguage` token scanner rather than a real
 * parser, reusing the same {@link ./highlightStyle} and {@link ./theme}, so a policy file picks up
 * all 27 themes and the font scale without a line of new CSS.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **This colours; it does not decide.** Whether a policy is *valid* is answered by the real
 * parser over HTTP (`POST /api/admin/access/policy/validate`), never here. A TypeScript
 * re-implementation of the grammar would be a second grammar that agrees for about a month — after
 * which the editor calls a file good and the boot refuses it, or worse, the other way round.
 *
 * <p>Three token decisions are worth knowing before changing anything:
 *
 * 1. **`deny` has a colour of its own.** A denial wins over every allow, at every level, across every
 *    grant source — it is the one line in a policy file nobody may skim past.
 * 2. **A keyword is only a keyword where a keyword can be.** `role:read` is an ordinary permission in
 *    a product that administers roles, so a word followed by `:` is read as a namespace and never as
 *    the `role` keyword. The backend's lexer makes the same allowance, for the same reason.
 * 3. **A hyphen inside a name is part of the name.** `storage-byte`, `parametric-search` and
 *    `id-organization-001` are one token each, not a subtraction between three. The backend reads them
 *    the same way — see `CursorMatcher.hyphenatedNameLength` — and the day it started accepting an
 *    unquoted hyphenated instance was the day this scanner had to stop rendering one as arithmetic.

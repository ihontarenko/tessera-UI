/**
 * The tags jMouse's own languages emit, on top of the standard set.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Why a tracker carries another product's language at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because a tracker's job is holding text *about* other systems, and a ticket about Innoventa's
 * authorization is a ` ```jmp ` fence. The earlier reasoning here — "jmp is Innoventa's domain, so it
 * stays out" — was the wrong test: it is the test for whether Tessera should *evaluate* a policy, not
 * for whether it should be able to show one. Innoventa's own note on this file makes the same
 * argument from the other side: a manual that documents a language in plain grey while an editor two
 * clicks away colours it has failed at one job.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **This colours; it does not decide.** Whether a policy is valid is answered by Innoventa's
 * parser and never here — Tessera has no opinion about a policy beyond how it reads.
 *
 * <p>Ported from `Innoventa/UI/src/lib/codemirror/tags.ts`, with the jME half dropped: an expression
 * language is only worth colouring where there is something to evaluate, and there is nothing here.
 *
 * <h2>Why these exist at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>`.jmp` and jME used to borrow generic tags — a role name was `tags.className`, a language word
 * was `tags.keyword` — and both resolve to the same colour in any style that does not care about the
 * difference. So `grants` and `ORGANIZATION_ADMIN` came out identically, which is precisely the pair
 * a reader most needs told apart: one is the language, the other is the thing being granted.
 *
 * <p>A borrowed tag also cannot be recoloured without recolouring every other language. `tags.keyword`
 * belongs to Markdown fences, SQL, JSON and everything else the editor renders; making *policy*
 * keywords pink by editing it would repaint the whole product.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Every tag names a parent, and that is load-bearing</h2>
 *
 * <p>`Tag.define(parent)` means a style written for the parent still applies when nothing claims the
 * child. That is what keeps the seventeen imported CodeMirror themes working: they know
 * `tags.keyword` and have never heard of {@link policyKeyword}, and under them a policy file stays
 * coloured — just in that theme's own scheme. Drop the parents and every forced theme renders a
 * policy as undifferentiated plain text.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ A parent must be a **plain** tag: `Tag.define` refuses a modified one, so
 * `tags.definition(tags.variableName)` and `tags.function(tags.variableName)` cannot be inherited
 * from however well they describe the child. Where the natural parent was a modified tag, the closest
 * plain relative is used instead — the choice only decides what a foreign theme falls back to, since
 * our own style names every tag here explicitly.

 * the words exist: `declare` opens something that says what exists at all, `assign` something that
 * says who has what. That is ADR-0018's line — the document owns structure, the row owns the case —
 * moved to the left margin so a reader sees it before reading anything.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **Deliberately not a colour of its own.** A prefix painted a second colour reads as a second
 * kind of thing, and the point is the opposite: it qualifies the keyword beside it. So it takes the
 * keyword's hue and is set apart by weight and slant instead — visible when scanning, silent when
 * reading.

 * position a permission's namespace does: the *subject* of the line, with everything after it saying
 * how much and until when. Sharing the colour without sharing the tag is what lets a palette split
 * the two later without anybody having to touch the grammar.
